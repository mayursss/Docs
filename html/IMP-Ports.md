Internet Corporation for Assigning Names and Numbers (ICANN).
By ICANN there are three categories for ports:

- From 0 to 1023 – well known ports assigned to common protocols and services
- From 1024 to 49151 – registered ports assigned by ICANN to a specific service
- From 49152 to 65 535 – dynamic (private, high) ports range from 49,152 to 65,535. Can be used by any service on an ad hoc basis. Ports are assigned when a session is established, and released when the session ends.
