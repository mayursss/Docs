# What is Clustering?
- A cluster is a group of independent computer systems (nodes) working together as a unified computing resource.
- cluster provides `high availability` and s`calability` to many types of server workloads including Hyper-V hosts, file servers, and different server applications such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange Server that can run on both physical servers and virtual machines.

# What are the types of clusters
There are two types of clusters as below:
- **Network load balancing (NLB)** cluster filters and distributes TCP/IP traffic across a range of nodes, regulating connection load according to administrator-defined port rules.
- **Failover cluster (server cluster)**  provides high availability for services, applications, and other resources through an architecture that maintains a consistent image of the cluster on all nodes and that allows nodes to transfer resource ownership on demand.

# What is Validation wizard?
- It will run tests to determine whether your `system`, `storage`, and `network configuration` is suitable for a cluster.  
- These tests include specific simulations of cluster actions, and fall into the following categories:
- System Configuration tests
- Network tests and Storage tests.
