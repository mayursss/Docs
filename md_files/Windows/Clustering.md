# What is Clustering?
- A cluster is a group of independent computer systems (nodes) working together as a unified computing resource.

# What are the types of clusters
- There are two types of clusters as below:
-    A network load balancing cluster filters and distributes TCP/IP traffic across a range of nodes, regulating connection load according to administrator-defined port rules.
-    A failover cluster provides high availability for services, applications, and other resources through an architecture that maintains a consistent image of the cluster on all nodes and that allows nodes to transfer resource ownership on demand.
